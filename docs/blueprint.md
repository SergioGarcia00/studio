# **App Name**: ScoreParser

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Allow users to upload an image containing a scoreboard.
- Text Extraction: Extract the names and scores from the image using OCR.
- Data Validation: Use an LLM tool to determine if each player entry has the required fields to save them successfully (name, team, and score) before saving the table.
- CSV File Generation: Generate a CSV file containing the extracted data.
- CSV File Download: Allow users to download the generated CSV file.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light purple (#A78BFA) to give a playful yet professional feel, subtly nodding to OCR technology (purple being one of the colours often associated to it).
- Background color: Very light grey (#F4F4F5), close to white, to make the layout feel very simple and clean.
- Accent color: A muted teal (#6EE7B7) to hint towards success, since we need successful data extraction.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a clean and modern look, very appropriate for an app related to computer vision.
- Use a clean and simple layout to make the application easy to use.
- Use simple icons to represent different actions (e.g. upload, download).
